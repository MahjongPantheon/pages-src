Mahjong Pantheon is a set of web-based software tools to automate regular riichi mahjong tournaments & local games.

### Subsystems

- **Mimir** is a specialized backend database which supports JSON-RPC calls for data operations.
- **Tyr** is mobile web application, which uses Mimir as its backend to provide online game overview and automated scoring abilities for every player with handheld device. See [screenshots](https://github.com/MahjongPantheon/pages-src/blob/Samhaina-patch-1/source/about/index.md#tyr-screenshots).
- **Rheda** is simple dynamic web frontend to show Mimir's data pretty and conveniently. It includes rating tables, statistics, graphs, last games and also some tournament administration tools (this will change, though). See [screenshots](https://github.com/MahjongPantheon/pages-src/blob/Samhaina-patch-1/source/about/index.md#rheda-screenshots).

### Software stack

All Pantheon tools are supposed to be web-based applications, which run either in browser or on a server. Tyr is written almost entirely in Typescript, Mimir and Rheda are written in PHP (5.5+). Mimir supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite databases as its backend.

 Production installation instructions are still WIP, but it should be pretty easy to install all three subsystems for anyone who is familiar with web development. Source code and development environment setup instructions are available on [github](https://github.com/MahjongPantheon/pantheon)
