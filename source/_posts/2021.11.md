title: Pantheon 2021.11 update
date: 2021-11-20 01:32:44

New major version of Pantheon has been deployed. New version has many improvements and changes, including new personal data management subsystem, which allows to use a single login/password for all events a player participates in.

Old version is still accessible at https://mjtop.net (with Rheda at https://gui.mjtop.net and Tyr at https://m.mjtop.net), though no new events will be created there. All existing events will eventually be finished and old version will be put into read-only mode. 

New version is located at https://riichi.top (with Rheda at https://r.riichi.top and Tyr at https://m.riichi.top).

As always, we appreciate useful feedback of our beta testers. Feel free to contact us on our support channels or directly via email.
