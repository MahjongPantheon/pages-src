title: Pantheon 2018.11 update
date: 2018-11-30 01:32:44
---
Since last update, Pantheon has moved to rolling release model. This means no new versions will be released, but Pantheon master branch is stable enough to be used at production servers as is.

As always, we appreciate useful feedback of our beta testers. Major changes by the date include internationalization of all subsystems, predefined seating, aggregated events and games cancellation.
